#Phonebook CLI Application (Java)# 📌 
University CSC212-Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
This **command-line-based phonebook program** was my **first-ever practical programming project**, built during my **second year at university** as part of my **Data Structures course**. It holds a special place in my journey as a developer, as it helped me understand **fundamental data structures** and how to implement them efficiently.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java
- **Data Structures Used:**
  - **Binary Tree** – for efficient searching and sorting of contacts.
  - **Doubly Linked List** – for flexible contact management (adding, deleting, modifying).

## 🎯 Key Features
- 📌 **Add, Search, Delete Contacts** – Stores contact names and numbers efficiently.
- 🔍 **Binary Tree for Fast Lookup** – Enables quick searching.
- 🔄 **Doubly Linked List for Dynamic Management** – Allows easy insertion and deletion.
- 🎓 **Educational Purpose** – A foundational project that deepened my understanding of **data structures & algorithms**.

## 📄 Installation & Usage
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phonebook-cli.git
cd phonebook-cli
javac Phonebook.java
java Phonebook
```

## 🎯 Future Improvements
- **GUI version** using JavaFX or Swing.
- **Integration with a database** (SQLite or MySQL) for persistent storage.
- **Export/Import contacts** as CSV or JSON.
